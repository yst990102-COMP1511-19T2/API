<p>
Write a C program <code>order3_challenge1.c</code>
that reads 3 integers and prints them  from smallest to largest.
<p>
You are not permitted to use <b>if</b> statements.
<p>
You are not permitted to use loops (e.g. <b>while</b>).
<p>
You are not permitted to call functions other than printf and scanf.  For example, you are not permitted
to use functions from the math library.
<p>
You are not permitted to use  <b>printf</b> inside expressions - you can only use <b>printf</b> as a statement
(the way it has been used in lectures).
<p>
You are not permitted to assign variables inside expressions - you can only assign variables as a statement
(the way it has been done in lectures).
<p>
For example, both of these are <b>invalid</b>:
<p>
<code> (a &lt; b) &amp;&amp; printf("a"); // invalid </code>
<p>
<code> (a &lt; b) &amp;&amp; (a = b); // invalid </code>
<p>
You can use <b>printf</b> to print the value of an  expression, in other words you can have an
expression inside <b>printf</b>.
<p>
You are only permitted to use parts of C covered in the weeks 1 and 2 lectures.  For example, you are not permitted to use the ternary ?: operator.  You are not permitted to define functions.
<p class="alert alert-danger">
You should invent your <b>own</b> solution - don't just google or ask others how do it!
<p>
Your program should behave exactly like this example:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./order3_challenge1</kbd>
Enter integer: <kbd>23</kbd>
Enter integer: <kbd>5</kbd>
Enter integer: <kbd>27</kbd>
The integers in order are: 5 23 27
<kbd class="shell">./order3_challenge1</kbd>
Enter integer: <kbd>3</kbd>
Enter integer: <kbd>6</kbd>
Enter integer: <kbd>27</kbd>
The integers in order are: 3 6 27
<kbd class="shell">./order3_challenge1</kbd>
Enter integer: <kbd>9</kbd>
Enter integer: <kbd>8</kbd>
Enter integer: <kbd>7</kbd>
The integers in order are: 7 8 9
</pre>

This is more puzzle than a programming exercise.
<p>
Try to invent your own solution -  don't google or ask others how do it.
<p>
Autotest is available to help you test your program - but it doesn't
check that your code meets the above restrictions.
