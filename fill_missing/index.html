Write a C program <b>fill_missing.c</b> which reads  integers  from standard input
until it reaches end-of-input.
<p>
It should then print the <i>missing</i> integers.
<p>
The <i>missing</i> integers should be all positive integers which did not appear in the program's input
and which are smaller than the largest integer which did appear in the program's input.
<p>
The <i>missing</i> integers should be printed in increasing order on a single line.
<p>
Match the the example below EXACTLY.

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./fill_missing</kbd>
<kbd>1
4
1
5
9
2
6
9</kbd>
<span class="eof"></span>
3 7 8
<kbd class="shell"></kbd>
</pre>
<b>Explanation:</b> given the input <b>1 4 1 5 9 2 6 9</b>, your program should print <b>3 7 8</b>, as those
are the <i>missing</i> values, because:
<ul>
<li>the largest value was <b>9</b>
<li>the numbers that appeared were {<b>1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9</b>}

<li>and thus, the numbers that were missing are {<b>3, 7, 8</b>}.
</li></li></li></ul>
<h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>

Your program must read until the end of-input.
End of input is signalled on a Linux terminal by typing the <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>d</b> keys together.
This is what <b>&lt;ctrl-d&gt;</b> indicates in the above examples.
<p>
You can assume the input will only only contain positive integers, one per line.
<p>
You can assume each line will contain one and only one integer.
<p>
You can assume your input contains at least one integer.
<p>
You can assume your input contains  no more than 10000 integers.
<p>
You can assume no integer will be smaller than 1.
<p>
You are free to write this program in any way you wish: there is no specific
function that you need to implement. Note that your program will need to have a `main` function.
