<b>count_favourite</b> is given  one argument, <b>head</b>, which is the pointer to the first node in a linked list.
<p>
Add code to <b>count_favourite</b> so that its returns the number of elements divisible by 17 in the list.
<p>
For example if the linked list contains these 8 elements:
<p>
<pre>
51, 7, 8, 9, 34, 19, 34, 42
</pre>
<p>
<b>count_favourite</b> should return <b>3</b> because  51, 34 and 34 are divisible by 17.
