{{ copy_a_file(name="swap_pointers.c", change_function="swap_pointers") }}

<b>swap_pointers</b> should take two pointers to integers as input and swap
the values stored in those two integers.
<p>
For example if the integers are:
<p>
<pre>
int first = 1;
int second = 2;
</pre>
<p>
After your function runs, first should be 2 and second should be 1.
