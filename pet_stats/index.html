In this exercise, you will read some pet information from standard input
and relay it in a human readable format.

{{ copy_a_file(name="pet_stats.c") }}
<p>
<b>pet_stats.c</b> already contains a struct for a pet and a main function. You
cannot change either of these and can only make changes to the functions: 
<b>setup_pet()</b> and <b>print_pet()</b>.
<p>
Your task in this exercise is first to complete the function <b>setup_pet()</b> 
so that it:
<ul>
<li>
Reads in a line from standard input and stores it in the name field
<li>
Reads in a line from standard input and stores it in the type field
<li>
Reads in an int from standard input and stores it in the age field
<li>
Reads in an int from standard input and stores it in the weight feild
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: don't use <b>scanf</b>, use  <b>fgets</b> to read the name and type strings.
<p>
You can assume each line contains at most 50 characters.
<p>
You will then need to complete the function <b>print_pet()</b> so that it writes
out a single line of text describing the pet, like: "Mr Snuffle-uffle-kins is a 
cat who is 4 years old and weighs 6kg\n"
<p>
When you have completed the functions <b>setup_pet()</b> and <b>print_pet()</b>
 this is how <b>pet_stats.c</b> should behave:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o pet_stats pet_stats.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./pet_stats </kbd>
Mr Snuffle-uffle-kins
cat
4
6
Mr Snuffle-uffle-kins is a cat who is 4 years old and weighs 6kg
<kbd class="shell">./pet_stats </kbd>
007
British Short-hair
35 78
007 is a British Short-hair who is 35 years old and weighs 78kg
</pre>
