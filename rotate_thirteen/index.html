to help you build your solution:

{{ include_code("rotate_thirteen.c", function_only="main") }}

<p>
Your <b>rotate_thirteen</b> function will be called directly in marking.  The main function is only to let you test your <b>rotate_thirteen</b> function
<p>
You can add more assert tests to  <b>main</b> to test your <b>rotate_thirteen</b> function.

<p>
You will need to use your <code>strings_equal</code> function
from the <b>strings_equal</b> activity
for tests to work.
