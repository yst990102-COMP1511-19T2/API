<p>
Write a C program, <code>reverse_array.c</code>,  which reads integers line by line,
and when it reaches the end of input, prints those integers in reverse order, line by line.
</p>
<p>
You will never be given more than <code>100</code> integers to print out.
<p>
The output from your program should look <b>exactly</b> like this:
</p>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc reverse_array.c -o reverse_array</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./reverse_array</kbd>
Enter numbers forwards:
<kbd>10</kbd>
<kbd>50</kbd>
<kbd>20</kbd>
<kbd>40</kbd> <span class="eof"></span>
Reversed:
40
20
50
10
<kbd class="shell">./reverse_array</kbd>
Enter numbers forwards:
<kbd>-5</kbd>
<kbd>-4</kbd>
<kbd>-3</kbd>
<kbd>-2</kbd>
<kbd>-1</kbd> <span class="eof"></span>
Reversed:
-1
-2
-3
-4
-5
</pre>

<h4>Need a Hint?</h4>
<p>
The result from calling <code>scanf</code> can be assigned to an integer, like so:
<pre class="program"><code class="lang-clike">
int scanned_in_value;
int result = scanf("%d", &amp;scanned_in_value);
</code></pre></p></p>

<p>
<code>result</code> will be equal to the number of variables that scanf
successfully scanned in.
<p>
<strong>Explanation</strong><br/>
In the code sample above, if the user does enter a number, scanf will be able to
read this in to the variable <code>scanned_in_value</code>, and thus it will
have successfully scanned in one value, so the variable <code>result</code> will
contain the value 1.
<p>
If the user had not entered a valid number (for example if they typed in a word
instead), there would be no integer there for scanf to read into
<code>scanned_in_value</code>, so scanf would not successfully scan in any
values, and so the variable <code>result</code> would contain the value 0.
<p>
<strong>Detecting the end of input</strong><br/>
The variable <code>result</code> can be used to determine whether your program
has reached the end of the input (hint: if there aren't any values left for
scanf to scan in, the <code>result</code> variable <em>won't</em> contain the
number <code>1</code>).
<p>
If you have a <code>while</code> loop condition that checks the result of
<code>scanf</code> to determine whether scanf was able to successfully scan the
expected number of variables, you can use this information to keep scanning
numbers until the user tells you to stop.
<p>
Note: on Mac/Linux, you can signal "end of input" on the command line by pressing
<kbd>Control + D</kbd>
