Write a C program <b>substitution.c</b> which reads characters from its input
and writes the  characters to its output encrypted with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">Substitution cipher</a>.
<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">Substitution cipher</a> maps each letter to
another letter.
<p>
The mapping will be given to your program as a single command line argument.
This command line argument will contain 26 characters:
an ordering of the letters 'a'..'z'.
<p>
Characters other than letters should not be encrypted.
<p>
Your program should stop only at the end of input.
<p>
Your program should contain at least one function other than main.
<p>
For example:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./substitution qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm</kbd>
<kbd>I was scared of dentists and the dark</kbd>
O vql leqktr gy rtfzolzl qfr zit rqka
<kbd>I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations</kbd>
O vql leqktr gy hktzzn uoksl qfr lzqkzofu egfctklqzogfl
<span class="eof"></span>
<kbd class="shell">./substitution abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</kbd>
<kbd>The identity cipher!!!</kbd>
The identity cipher!!!
<span class="eof"></span>
<kbd class="shell">./substitution bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza</kbd>
<kbd>The Caesar cipher is a subset of the substitution cipher!</kbd>
Uif Dbftbs djqifs jt b tvctfu pg uif tvctujuvujpo djqifs!
<span class="eof"></span>
</pre>

Your program will only be tested with an appropriate command line argument -
but a good programmer would check the command line argument is present and appropriate.
