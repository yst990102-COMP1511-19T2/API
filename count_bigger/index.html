{{ copy_a_file(name="count_bigger.c", change_function="count_bigger") }}

<b>count_bigger</b> should return a single integer: the number of values in
the array which are larger than 99 or smaller than -99.
<p>
For example if the array contains these 8 elements:
<p>
<pre>
141, 5, 92, 6, 535, -89, -752, -3
</pre>
<p>
Your function should return <b>3</b>, because these 3 elements are
bigger than 99 or smaller than -99:
<p>
<pre>
141, 535, -752
</pre>
<p>
