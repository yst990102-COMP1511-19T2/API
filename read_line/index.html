In the next few activities,
you'll be building some functions
that deal with strings.
<p>
Remember that a string is an array of values representing characters,
where the last character is followed by the special value 0 often written as <code>'\0'</code> in C.
We refer to this zero marking the end of the string as the <strong>null terminator</strong>.
<p>
{{ copy_a_file(name="read_line.c", change_function="read_line") }}

<b>read_line</b> takes an array, which we call a "buffer",
the size of that array,
and shhould read a line of text
  from standard input using <b>getchar</b> into the buffer.
<p>
Assume a line of text will always end with the newline character, <code>\n</code>.
You should not write the newline into the buffer.
<p>
If more characters are available to be read
than there is array space to read it into,
you should stop after you have filled the array.
<p>
You should never lose characters, except for the newline.
<p>
You should always make sure that,
when your function returns,
you have null-terminated the buffer.
<h4>Testing</h4>

<b>read_line.c</b> also contains a simple <b>main</b> function which allows you to test your <b>read_line</b> function.
<p>
<p>
Do not change this main function.  If you want to change it, you have misread the question.
<p>
Your <b>read_line</b> function will be called directly in marking.  The main function is only to let you test your <b>read_line</b> function
<p>
Here is how <b>read_line.c</b> should behave after you add the correct code to the function <b>read_line</b>:


<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc read_line.c -o read_line</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./read_line</kbd>
<kbd>hello world</kbd>
&lt;hello world&gt;
</pre>
