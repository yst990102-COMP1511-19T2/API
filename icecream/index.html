<p>Create and open a new file called <code>icecream.c</code> for this exercise.</p>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">gedit icecream.c &amp;</kbd>
</pre>
<p>Matilda wants to buy some ice-cream, but she only has $10.
Write a program so that she can input how many scoops of ice-cream
she wants and how much each scoop costs and it will let her know if
she has enough money.
<p>
Your program should behave as follows:</p>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o icecream icecream.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./icecream</kbd>
How many scoops? 5
How many dollars does each scoop cost? 1
You have enough money!
<kbd class="shell">./icecream</kbd>
How many scoops? 5
How many dollars does each scoop cost? 3
Oh no, you don't have enough money :(
</pre>
<p>You can assume that Matilda will only give you positive integers.</p>
