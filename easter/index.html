then calculates the date of Easter Sunday for that year.

<p>Note that the original proposal of this formula had only single letter variable names, and no explanation of how it works.</p>
<p>Because of this, even though we know <i>that</i> it works, no-one knows <i>how</i> it works.</p>
<p>Make sure to always comment your code and have sensible variable names so that people can understand how your code works!</p>
