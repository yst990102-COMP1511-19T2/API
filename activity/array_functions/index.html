In this exercise, you'll be creating a small collection of functions
that could help you with working on arrays.

{{ copy_a_file(name="array_functions.c") }}

Your task is to implement the missing functions in  <b>array_functions.c</b>
<p>
and <em>implement</em> the functions.

<p>Some of these functions
read through an array
and return some information about the array
but do not change the array in any way.

<p>These functions are:

<ul>
  <li><code>array_max</code>; which returns the maximum value in the array,</li>
  <li><code>array_min</code>; which returns the minimum value in the array,</li>
  <li><code>array_average</code>; which returns the average value in the array, and</li>
  <li><code>array_sum</code>; which returns the sum of all values in the array.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other functions <em>change</em> the array values
or have an effect outside the program.
We say that these functions have <em>side effects</em>
as they do something other than
just return a value.

<p>These functions are:

<ul>
  <li><code>array_add</code>;
which adds a value to every element in the array,</li>
  <li><code>array_scale</code>;
which multiplies every value in array
by the same value, and</li>
  <li><code>scan_array</code>;
which reads in values from input
and stores them in the array</li>
  <li><code>show_array</code>;
which shows an array on the screen
in the style <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></li>
  <li><code>copy_array</code>;
which copies one array into another</li>
</ul>


The file <code>array_functions.c</code> contains a main function
with some unit tests to help you test your functions.
