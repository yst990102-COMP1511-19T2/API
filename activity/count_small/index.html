{{ copy_a_file(name="count_small.c", change_function="count_small") }}

Add code so that <b>count_small</b> returns the number of "small" values in the
array.
Note: a "small" value is between -9 and +9 inclusive.

<p>
For example if the array contains these 9 elements:
<p>
<pre>
16, 7, 8, 12, 13, -9, -3, 12, -9
</pre>
<p>
Your function should return <b>5</b>, because these 5 elements are small
(between -9 and 9 inclusive):
<p>
<pre>
7, 8, -9, -3, -9
</pre>
<p>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<b>count_small.c</b> also contains a simple <b>main</b> function which allows
you to test your <b>count_small</b> function.
<p>

Your <b>count_small</b> function will be called directly in marking.
The main function is only to let you test your <b>count_small</b> function
<p>
<h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>

An small number is &gt; -10 and &lt; 10
<p>
<b>count_small</b> should return a single integer.
<p>
<b>count_small</b> should not change the array it is given.
<p>
<b>count_small</b> should not call scanf (or getchar or fgets).
<p>
<b>count_small</b> can assume the array contains at least one integer.
<p>
<b>count_small</b> function should not print anything. It should not call printf.
