A citizen science project monitoring whale populations
has files of containing large numbers of whale observations.
Each line in these files contains:

<ul>
<li> the date the observation was made
<li> the number of whales in the pod
<li> the species of whales
</li></li></li></ul>

Here is a <a href="{{activity_url}}/whales.txt">file of example data</a> which you can
download to test your program. The first 10 lines are:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">head whales.txt</kbd>
18/01/18  9 Pygmy right whale
01/09/17 21 Southern right whale
16/02/18  4 Striped dolphin
02/07/17  4 Common dolphin
19/02/18  4 Blue whale
21/02/18 38 Dwarf sperm whale
14/06/17 29 Southern right whale
20/06/17  3 Spinner dolphin
22/07/17 34 Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin
20/03/18  7 Long-finned pilot whale
...
</pre>

{{ copy_a_file(name="orca.c", change_function="count_orca_sightings") }}
<p>
<b>orca.c</b> already contains the functions which
you discussed in your tutorial which read the file of whale sightings into an array of structs.
You do not need need to change these functions.
<p>
The main function in <b>orca.c</b> has this code:

<pre class="program">
int n_orca_pods = count_orca_sightings(n_sightings, whale_sightings);
printf("%d Orca sightings in %s\n", n_orca_pods, argv[1]);
</pre>

Your task in this exercise is only to complete <b>count_orca_sightings</b>
<p>
Do <b>not</b>  change any other function.
<p>
It should return a  count of the number of sightings of Orca pods in the file.
<p>
Note,  "pod" is the collective noun for a group of whales.
<p>
<b>count_orca_sightings</b> should return
the number of Orca pods.  It does not have have to sum the number of individual whales in these pods.

<p>
When you have completed the function <b>count_orca_sightings</b> this is how <b>orca.c</b> should behave:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o orca orca.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./orca whales.txt</kbd>
53 Orca sightings in whales.txt
</pre>
<b>Hint</b>: hint use <code>strcmp</code> from <code>string.h</code>
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: most of the work for this exercise is figuring out what to do - only a short loop containing an if statement is needed.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: if you are having trouble understanding structs COMP1511 tutors Dean Wunder and Ben Pieters-Hawke take you through the basics in this video:
