<p>Now create and open a new file called <code>negative.c</code> for this exercise.</p>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">gedit negative.c &amp;</kbd>
</pre>
<p>Write a program that uses <code>scanf</code> to get a number from a user and prints
"Don't be so negative!" if they entered a negative number.<br/>
If the number is positive, the program should print "You have entered a positive number."<br/>
If the user enters the number 0, the program should print
"You have entered zero."<br/>
Note: you can assume that the number will always be a whole number (i.e. an integer)<br/>
Your program should behave as follows:</p>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o negative negative.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./negative</kbd>
3
You have entered a positive number.
<kbd class="shell">./negative</kbd>
-3
Don't be so negative!
<kbd class="shell">./negative</kbd>
0
You have entered zero.
</pre>
