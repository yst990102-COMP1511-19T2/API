Write a C program <code>line_char.c</code> which reads a line from its input
then reads an integer <b>n</b> from its input.
<p>
It should write the character in position <b>n</b> from the line in the format given in the examples below.
<p>
Your program should then exit - it should not read more lines.
<p>
For example:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o line_char line_char.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./line_char</kbd>
<kbd>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0</kbd>
The character in position 0 is 'a'
<kbd class="shell">./line_char</kbd>
<kbd>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
13</kbd>
The character in position 13 is 'n'
<kbd class="shell">./line_char</kbd>
<kbd>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
25</kbd>
The character in position 25 is 'z'
<kbd class="shell">./line_char</kbd>
<kbd>Andrew Rocks!
6</kbd>
The character in position 6 is ' '
<kbd class="shell">./line_char</kbd>
<kbd>Andrew Rocks!
7</kbd>
The character in position 7 is 'R'
<kbd class="shell">./line_char</kbd>
<kbd>Andrew Rocks!
12</kbd>
The character in position 12 is '!'
<kbd class="shell"></kbd>
</pre>

No error checking is necessary.
<p>
You can assume a line can be read.
<p>
You can assume the line will contain at most 256 characters.
<p>
You can assume a positive integer <b>n</b> can be read.
<p>
You can assume the line read has at least <b>n</b> characters.
