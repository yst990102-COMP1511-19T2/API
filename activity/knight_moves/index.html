This question was taken from a past exam paper. It is an example of the hardest
question at the end of the paper and it is usually expected that less than 5%
of students can complete this question within the time constraints.
<p>
Write a C program knight_moves.c which prints  sequences of moves which takes a knight from a specified
square on a chessboard to another specified square on the chessboard.
<p>
A chessboard is an 8x8 square matrix.  We label each square as below:
<p>
<pre class="command_line">
a8 b8 c8 d8 e8 f8 g8 h8
a7 b7 c7 d7 e7 f7 g7 h7
a6 b6 c6 d6 e6 f6 g6 h6
a5 b5 c5 d5 e5 f5 g5 h5
a4 b4 c4 d4 e4 f4 g4 h4
a3 b3 c3 d3 e3 f3 g3 h3
a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 f2 g2 h2
a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 f1 g1 h1
</pre>
<p>
A knight makes an L-shaped move.  It moves either two squares horizontally and one square vertically
or two squares vertically and one square horizontally.
<p>
For example, a knight at <i>d4</i> can move to one of eight squares: <i>c2</i>, <i>e2</i>, <i>b3</i>, <i>b5</i>, <i>c6</i>, <i>e6</i>, <i>f3</i> or <i>f5</i>.
<p>
A move can not take a knight off the chessboard.  Hence, a knight on square near the edge of
the board will have fewer possible moves.
<p>
For example, a knight at <i>a1</i> can move only to <i>c2</i> and <i>b3</i>.
<p>
Write a C program which takes  two arguments: a starting square and
and a finishing square.
<p>
It should print a sequence of moves which take a knight from
the starting square to the finishing square.
This sequence of moves should be as short as possible.
<p>
In many cases there are multiple shortest sequences,
your program must print all of the sequences in alphabetic order
<p>
For example:
<p>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o knight_moves knight_moves.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./knight_moves d4 b3</kbd>
d4 b3 
<kbd class="shell">./knight_moves d4 a1</kbd>
d4 b3 a1
d4 c2 a1
<kbd class="shell">./knight_moves g2 b2</kbd>
g2 e1 d3 b2
g2 e3 c4 b2
g2 e3 d1 b2
g2 f4 d3 b2
</pre>
<p>
<b>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications</b>
<p>
<p>
Your program must complete in 60 seconds when executed with dcc --valgrind
<p>
Your can assume there are two command-line arguments and they correctly identify squares on the board.
<p>
You can assume the starting and finishing squares are different.
<p>
No error checking required
