<p>We use loops in C to do things multiple times. Here is an example of a loop
that prints all the numbers from 1 to 17 on a new line in ascending order:</p>
<pre class="program"><code class="lang-clike">
//initialise counter to 1
int counter = 1; 
// loop until not &lt;= 17
while (counter &lt;= 17) { 
    // print counter
    printf("%d\n", counter);
    // increment counter
    counter = counter + 1; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this exercise you will use a loop to print a countdown from 10 to 0.
Start by creating a file called <code>countdown.c</code>, and copying
the above code. Modify this code so that the loop counts down from 10 until 0.</p>
