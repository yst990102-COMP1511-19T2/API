For this activity,
you'll be writing the function <code>string_copy</code>
<p>
It takes a string in the <code>source</code> buffer,
and copies it to the <code>destination</code> buffer,
which is <code>dest_size</code> elements in size.
If there are more characters in <code>source</code>
than there is array space in <code>destination</code>,
you should stop after you have filled the array.
You should always make sure that
your function null-terminates
the <code>destination</code> array.
