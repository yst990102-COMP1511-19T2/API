<p>Create a program called <code>wordAddition.c</code>.
<p class="alert alert-danger">For this challenge exercise, you can <b>only use the topics that we've covered in the course thus far</b> (if/elseif/else, printf, scanf, ints).</p>
<p>
This program should ask for two integers
using the message
<code>Please enter two integers: </code>
 and then display the sum of the integers as
<code><kbd><i>n</i></kbd> + <kbd><i>n</i></kbd> = <kbd><i>sum</i></kbd></code>.</p>
<p>Any numbers that are between zero and ten should appear as words.
This also applies to negative numbers between negative ten and zero.
All other numbers should appear as decimal integers.</p>
<p class="alert alert-warning">Make sure to replace the <strong><em>n</em></strong> with the numbers entered
in the same order
and the <strong><em>sum</em></strong> with the sum of the two numbers.</p>
<h4>Some Examples</h4>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./wordAddition</kbd>
Please enter two integers: <kbd>2 5</kbd>
two + five = seven
</pre>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./wordAddition</kbd>
Please enter two integers: <kbd>3 0</kbd>
three + zero = three
</pre>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./wordAddition</kbd>
Please enter two integers: <kbd>-1 5</kbd>
negative one + five = four
</pre>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./wordAddition</kbd>
Please enter two integers: <kbd>10 5</kbd>
ten + five = 15
</pre>
