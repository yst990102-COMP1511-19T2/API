Write a C program <b>indivisible.c</b> which reads integers &gt; 1 from standard input
until it reaches end-of-input.
<p>
It should then print the  integers read which are not exactly divisible by any other of the integers read.
<p>
In other words it should not print an integer if
another integer that has been read is a factor of that number.
<p>
You may assume that the program's input will contain only positive integers one per line.
<p>
You may assume that all integers are &gt; 1.
<p>
You can assume at most 1000 integers will be read before end-of-input is reached.
<p>
Match the the example below EXACTLY.

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./indivisible</kbd>
<kbd>42

12</kbd>
<span class="eof"></span>
Indivisible numbers: 7 6
<kbd class="shell">./indivisible</kbd>
