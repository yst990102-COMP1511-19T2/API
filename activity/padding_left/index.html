<p>
<p>
<b>padding_left</b> is written using the following structs that cannot be changed:
<p>
<pre>
// A node in a linked list of characters.
struct character_node {
    char data;
    struct character_node *next;
};
</pre>
<p>
The <b>character_node</b> struct holds a character, as part of a linked list of characters.
<p>
<b>pad_left</b> is given a pointer to a <b>character_node</b>, which is the
first element in a list of characters. It is also given a character to "pad" with.

<p>
When you "pad" a character list, you iterate over the list and "push" every character along one.
This means that the second character becomes whatever the first character was. The third becomes
whatever the second was, and so on.
The first character becomes <b>pad_character</b>, and what was previously the last character is
"forgotten".
</p>
<p>
For example if a list of characters called <b>characters</b> looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
abcdef
</pre>
<p>
Then the following function is called:
<p>
<pre>
pad_left(characters, 't');
</pre>
<p>
The list <b>characters</b> would be:
<p>
<pre>
tabcde
</pre>

<h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>
<p>
<b>struct character_node</b> cannot be edited. It must be
used as is.
<p>
The <b>string_to_characters</b>, <b>print_characters</b>, and
<b>free_characters</b> functions will help you test and run your program.
They cannot be edited and must be used as it is. <i>You should not use them 
yourself in <b>pad_left</b></i>
<p>
<b>pad_left</b> cannot return a new head, so you cannot add to the head of the list.
You should complete this task solely by moving around data -
you will not need to malloc yourself.
<p>
Your submitted file may contain a main function. It will not be tested or marked.
