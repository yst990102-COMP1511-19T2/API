{{ copy_a_file(name="array_maximum.c", change_function="array_maximum") }}

<p>
The above file <b>array_maximum.c</b> contains a function
<b>array_maximum</b>, which should find the maximum value in the array.

<p>
Unfortunately, the provided function doesn't actually work. For this lab
exercise, your task is to complete this function.

<p>
The file also contains a main function which you can use to help test
your <b>array_maximum</b> function. It has two simple test cases.

<p>
This main function will not be marked -- you must write all of your code
in the <b>array_maximum</b> function.

You may modify the main function if you wish (e.g. to add further tests),
but only the <b>array_maximum</b> function will be marked.

<p>
Once your program is working, the output from the two provided tests in
the main function should be:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o array_maximum array_maximum.c </kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./array_maximum </kbd>
The largest value from array1 is: 15
The largest value from array2 is: 512
</pre>
