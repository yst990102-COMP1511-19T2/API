Write a C program <b>crack_substitution.c</b> which decrypts text encrypted by an unknown
s cipher.
<p>
Your program should make no assumptions about the language of the original text - don't assume its English.
In other words don't hard code English properties into your program,
extract the statistical properties from the sample plain text.
However, you can assume the English alphabet ('a'..'z').
<p>
Your program will be given as a command-line argument the name of a file containing a large amount of
unencrypted text in the same language as the encrypted text.
<p>
Your program will be given the encrypted text on standard input.
You may read it all before printing the decryption.
<p>
For example:

<kbd class="shell">./crack_substitution wiki_sentences.txt</kbd>

I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, in Bel-Air now
Hot summer nights, mid July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Challenging angels in a new age now
Hot summer days, rock n roll
The way you play for me at your show
And all the ways, I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

You may assume the  encrypted text on stdin contains at most 10000 characters.
<p>
You may assume the unencrypted example text in the file  contains at most 250000 characters.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: you will need to look at the probabilities of sequences of 2 or
perhaps 3 letters occurring or perhaps the probabilities of words.
<p>
b&gt;Hint</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>:  the C library functions  <b>fopen</b>, <b>fgetc</b> which
which you need  to read the file haven't been covered lectures.  You'll need to research these.
<p>
An autotest is available to help you test your program but because this is a difficult problem it
is possible very good attempts at the problem won't pass the autotests.
