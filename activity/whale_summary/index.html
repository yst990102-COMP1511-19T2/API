{{ copy_a_file(name="whale_summary.c", change_function="whale_summary") }}
<p>

The main function in <b>whale_summary.c</b>has this code:

<pre class="program">
whale_summary(n_sightings, whale_sightings);
</pre>

Your task in this exercise is to complete <b>whale_summary</b>
<p>
Do <b>not</b>  change any other function.
<p>
<b>whale_summary</b> should <b>print</b> for every whale species how many pods were seen and how
many total whales were seen of that species.

<p>
Match the example output form EXACTLY, except you may print the lines in any order.
<p>
When you have completed the function <b>whale_summary</b> this is how <b>whale_summary.c</b> should behave:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o whale_summary whale_summary.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./whale_summary whales.txt</kbd>
59 Pygmy right whale pods containing 1260 whales
55 Southern right whale pods containing 1252 whales
68 Striped dolphin pods containing 1337 whales
62 Common dolphin pods containing 1232 whales
51 Blue whale pods containing 1171 whales
58 Dwarf sperm whale pods containing 1272 whales
52 Spinner dolphin pods containing 1118 whales
43 Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin pods containing 897 whales
50 Long-finned pilot whale pods containing 996 whales
68 Short-finned pilot whale pods containing 1344 whales
49 Dwarf minke whale pods containing 1080 whales
53 Orca pods containing 1245 whales
57 Pygmy sperm whale pods containing 1346 whales
55 Humpback whale pods containing 1071 whales
65 Fin whale pods containing 1251 whales
53 Coastal bottlenose dolphin pods containing 1169 whales
55 Sei whale pods containing 929 whales
47 Bryde's whale pods containing 1023 whales
</pre>

You may assume there are at most 256 different whale species.
<p>
If <b>autotest</b> gives you an uninitialized variable error, you can
reproduce this by compiling and running with <code>dcc --valgrind</code>, e.g.:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc --valgrind -o whale_summary whale_summary.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./whale_summary whales.txt</kbd>
Runtime error: uninitialized variable accessed.

Execution stopped here in whale_summary(n_sightings=1000, sightings=0x1ffee9fbf0) in whale_summary.c at line 113:
....
</pre>

Beware the error may reported later than you expect.
<p>
Look back through your code for a variable, such as an array element, that has not
been assigned an initial value before it is used.
