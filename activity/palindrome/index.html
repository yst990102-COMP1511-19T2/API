A palindrome is a sequence which is the same forwards
as backwards.
<p>
Write a program, <code>palindrome.c</code>, which reads a string and tests if
it is a palindrome.
<p>
For example:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./palindrome</kbd>
<kbd>Enter a string:</kbd> kayak
String is a palindrome
<kbd class="shell">./palindrome</kbd>
<kbd>Enter a string:</kbd> canoe
String is not a palindrome
<kbd class="shell">./palindrome</kbd>
<kbd>Enter a string:</kbd> if if fi fi
String is a palindrome
<kbd class="shell">./palindrome</kbd>
<kbd>Enter a string:</kbd> if if if fi
String is not a palindrome
</pre>
<b>Hint</b>: don't use <b>scanf</b>, use  <b>fgets</b> to read the string.
<p>
Note, your program needs to read only one line - it doesn't have to read until the end of input.
<p>
You can assume the line contains at most 4096 characters.
