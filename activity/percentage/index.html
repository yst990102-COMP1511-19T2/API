Write a C program <code>percentage.c</code> to calculate the marks that a
student got in an exam.
<p>
Your program should scan in two integers: the total number of marks in the exam,
and how many marks the student was awarded.
<p>
It should then print out what mark they got in the exam, i.e. what percentage of
the marks the student was awarded for that exam, with no decimal places.
<p>
You are not permitted to use the math library for this question.
<p>
Your program should behave exactly like this example:
<p>
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./percentage</kbd>
Enter the total number of marks in the exam: <kbd>10</kbd>
Enter the number of marks the student was awarded: <kbd>5</kbd>
The student scored 50% in this exam.
<kbd class="shell">./percentage</kbd>
Enter the total number of marks in the exam: <kbd>10</kbd>
Enter the number of marks the student was awarded: <kbd>1</kbd>
The student scored 10% in this exam.
<kbd class="shell">./percentage</kbd>
Enter the total number of marks in the exam: <kbd>5</kbd>
Enter the number of marks the student was awarded: <kbd>2</kbd>
The student scored 40% in this exam.
<kbd class="shell">./percentage</kbd>
Enter the total number of marks in the exam: <kbd>1</kbd>
Enter the number of marks the student was awarded: <kbd>1</kbd>
The student scored 100% in this exam.
<kbd class="shell">./percentage</kbd>
Enter the total number of marks in the exam: <kbd>100</kbd>
Enter the number of marks the student was awarded: <kbd>5</kbd>
The student scored 5% in this exam.
<kbd class="shell">./percentage</kbd>
Enter the total number of marks in the exam: <kbd>3</kbd>
Enter the number of marks the student was awarded: <kbd>1</kbd>
The student scored 33% in this exam.
<kbd class="shell">./percentage</kbd>
Enter the total number of marks in the exam: <kbd>20</kbd>
Enter the number of marks the student was awarded: <kbd>0</kbd>
The student scored 0% in this exam.
<kbd class="shell">./percentage</kbd>
Enter the total number of marks in the exam: <kbd>3</kbd>
Enter the number of marks the student was awarded: <kbd>2</kbd>
The student scored 67% in this exam.

<p>
You can assume that the user supplies two integers. You do not have to
check the return value from scanf.
<p>
You can assume that the user enters valid input. This means that the
first integer will always be greater than or equal to the second
integer (i.e. the student will never be awarded more marks than the
exam was worth).
<p>
Hint: you can print out a percent symbol in printf using two percent
symbols, i.e. <code>printf("100%%");</code> would print out
<code>100%</code>.
<p>
Hint: you can change how many decimal points are printed out, e.g.
<code>printf("%.2lf", 1.23456);</code> would print out
<code>1.23</code>.
