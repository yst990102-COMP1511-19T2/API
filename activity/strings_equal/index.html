<p>You've probably noticed that
you can't use the comparison operator, <code>==</code>,
to compare strings.
So, how do we compare two strings?
For this activity,
you'll be writing a function to do exactly that:


{{ copy_a_file(name="strings_equal.c", change_function="strings_equal") }}


<p>It takes two strings, <code>string1</code> and <code>string2</code>,
and, if they are element-for-element the same,
it returns <em>1</em>, and <em>0</em> otherwise.
You shouldn't ever read beyond
the null-terminator of either string.

{{ copy_a_file(name="strings_equal.c", change_function="strings_equal") }}

<b>strings_equal.c</b> also contains a simple <b>main</b> function with  some simple <code>assert</code>-based tests
to help you build your solution:

{{ include_code("strings_equal.c", function_only="main") }}

<p>
Your <b>strings_equal</b> function will be called directly in marking.  The main function is only to let you test your <b>strings_equal</b> function
<p>
You can add more assert tests to  <b>main</b> to test your <b>strings_equal</b> function.
