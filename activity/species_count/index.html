{{ copy_a_file(name="species_count.c", change_function="species_count") }}
<p>
<b>species_count.c</b> already contains the functions which
you discussed in your tutorial which reads the file of whale sightings into an array of structs.
You do not need need to change these functions.
<p>
The main function in <b>species_count.c</b> has this code:

<pre class="program">
int pod_count;
int whale_count;
species_count(species, n_sightings, whale_sightings, &amp;pod_count, &amp;whale_count);
printf("%d %s pods containing %d whales in %s\n", pod_count, species, whale_count, filename);
</pre>

Your task in this exercise is to complete <b>species_count</b>.
<p>
Do <b>not</b>  change any other function.
<p>
<b>species_count</b> should assign the number of pods of the given species to <code>*n_pods</code> and  the total number of whales of the given species to <code>*n_whales</code>
<p>
When you have completed the function <b>species_count</b> this is how <b>species_count.c</b> should behave:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o species_count species_count.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./species_count whales.txt "Blue whale"</kbd>
51 Blue whale pods containing 1171 whales in whales.txt
<kbd class="shell">./species_count whales.txt "Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin"</kbd>
43 Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin pods containing 897 whales in whales.txt
</pre>
