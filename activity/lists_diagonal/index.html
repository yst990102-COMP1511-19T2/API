{{ copy_a_file(name="lists_diagonal.c", change_function="has_diagonal") }}

<b>lists_diagonal</b> is written using the following structs that cannot be changed:
<p>
<pre>
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};

struct list_node {
    struct node *my_list;
    struct list_node *next;
};
</pre>
<p>
The <b>node</b> struct is a normal linked list node.
<p>
The <b>list_node</b> struct is used to make a linked list where each element 
contains a list of <b>node</b>s.
<p>
<b>has_diagonal</b> should take a pointer to the head of a <b>list_node</b> list
and return a 1 if it finds a diagonal or a 0 if it doesn't. A diagonal in this
exercise means that the first number in the first list is the same as the second
number in the second list and the third number in the third list and so on.
<p>
For example if the list of lists looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
list_node 0 contains the list {5, 0, 0}
list_node 1 contains the list {0, 5, 0}
list_node 2 contains the list {0, 0, 5}
</pre>
<p>
<b>has_diagonal</b> should return 1.
<p>However, if the list of lists looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
list_node 0 contains the list {5, 0, 0, 0}
list_node 1 contains the list {0, 4, 0, 0}
list_node 2 contains the list {0, 0, 5, 0}
list_node 3 contains the list {0, 0, 0, 5}
</pre>
<p>
<b>has_diagonal</b> should return 0, because the 2nd element of the second list
does not equal the value of the first element of the first list.
<h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>
<p>
<b>struct node</b> and <b>struct list_node</b> cannot be edited. They must be used 
as they are.
<p>
You may not use arrays in this solution. Arrays are not necessary to complete this
task.
<p>
You can assume that you'll never receive an empty list of <b>list_node</b>s.
<p>
You can assume that all lists of <b>node</b>s are also not empty.
<p>
You can assume that there will always be the same number of <b>node</b>s in each
list and that will be the same number of <b>list_node</b>s. That is to say, the
2D grid formed by the lists will always be square.
