For this activity,
you'll be writing the function <code>string_length</code>.
It takes a string,
and finds its length,
excluding the null-terminator.

{{ copy_a_file(name="string_length.c", change_function="string_length") }}

<b>string_length.c</b> also contains a simple <b>main</b> function with  some simple <code>assert</code>-based tests
to help you build your solution:

{{ include_code("string_length.c", function_only="main") }}

<p>
Your <b>string_length</b> function will be called directly in marking.  The main function is only to let you test your <b>string_length</b> function
<p>
You can add more assert tests to  <b>main</b> to test your <b>string_length</b> function.
