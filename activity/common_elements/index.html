<b>common_elements</b> should  copy  the values in the first source array which are also found in the second source array, into the
third array.
<p>
In other words,  all of the elements that appear in both of the <b>source1</b> and <b>source2</b> should be copied
to the third <b>destination</b> array, in the order that they appear in the first array.

<b>common_elements</b> should return a single integer: the number of elements copied to the <b>destination</b> array.
<p>
For example, if the source arrays contained the following 6 elements:
<p>
source1: <b>1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2</b>
<p>
source2: <b>1, 1, 8, 2, 5, 3</b>
<p>
<b>common_elements</b> should copy these 4 values to the <b>destination</b> array: <b>1, 1, 5, 2</b>
<p>
The value 4 and 9 do not get copied because they do not occur in the second array.
<p>
<b>common_elements</b> should return the integer <b>4</b>, because there were 4 values copied.
<p>
<b>common_elements</b> should copy the elements in the order that they appear in the first array.
<p>
If a value in the first array occurs one or more times in the second array, each occurrence
of those values in the first array should be copied.
<p>
It doesn't matter how many times the values occur in the second array, as long as the values
occur at least once.

For example. if the two arrays contained the following 5 elements:
<p>
source1: <b>1, 2, 3, 2, 1</b>
<p>
source2: <b>1, 2, 3, 4, 5 </b>
<p>
Your function should copy all five values (<b>1, 2, 3, 2, 1</b>) from <b>source1</b> to the <b>destination</b> array
{{{

}}}
as all of the values (<b>1, 2, 3</b>) appeared at least once in <b>source2</b> and it
should return 5 because because 5 values were copied.

<h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>

You can assume the two source arrays contain only positive integers.
<p>
You can assume that all three arrays are the same size (<b>length</b>) and <b>length</b> is &gt; 0.
<p>
You cannot assume anything about the number of common elements, i.e. there may not be any
common elements between both arrays, or conversely, the entire contents of the first array
may also be present in the second array.
<p>
<b>common_elements</b> should return a single integer.
<p>
<b>common_elements</b> should not change the array it is given.
<p>
<b>common_elements</b> should not call scanf (or getchar or fgets).
<p>
<b>common_elements</b> should not print anything. It should not call printf.
