Write a C program <b>crack_caesar.c</b> which decrypts text encrypted by an unknown
Caesar cipher.
<p>
Your program should make no assumptions about the language of the original text - don't assume its English. However, you can assume the English alphabet ('a'..'z').
<p>
Your program will be given as a command-line argument the name of a file containing a large amount of
unencrypted text in the same language as the encrypted text.
<p>
For example for example your program might be given  <a href="{{activity_url}}wiki_sentences.txt">this file</a> containing 188k characters of English text
<small>(wikipedia sentences from <a href="https://github.com/CrowdTruth/Short-Text-Corpus-For-Humor-Detection">here</a>)</small>
<p>
Your program will be given the encrypted text on standard input.
It should print its decryption.
<p>
For example, here is some English text encrypted with a Caesar cipher with an unknown shift:

<pre>
Kyzj zj fli crjk xffuspv
Z yrkv kf wvvc kyv cfmv svknvve lj uzv
Slk zk'j fmvi
Aljk yvri kyzj reu kyve Z'cc xf
Pfl xrmv dv dfiv kf czmv wfi
Dfiv kyre pfl'cc vmvi befn
</pre>

So for example:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">./crack_caesar wiki_sentences.txt</kbd>
<kbd>Kyzj zj fli crjk xffuspv
Z yrkv kf wvvc kyv cfmv svknvve lj uzv
Slk zk'j fmvi
Aljk yvri kyzj reu kyve Z'cc xf
Pfl xrmv dv dfiv kf czmv wfi
Dfiv kyre pfl'cc vmvi befn</kbd>
<span class="eof"></span>
This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over
Just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for
More than you'll ever know
</pre>

You may assume the  encrypted text of stdin contains at most 10000 characters.
<p>
You may assume the unencrypted example text in the file  contains at most 250000 characters.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: use <code>fopen</code> to open the file and <code>fgetc</code> to read the file.  If you haven't seen them in lectures yet, read this <a href="{{url_root}}code/reading_and_writing_files/cat_fgetc.c">example program</a> to see how to use this functions to read a file.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>: read all the encrypted text into an array, then decrypt it.
