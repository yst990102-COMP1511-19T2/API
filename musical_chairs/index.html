Welcome to the Game of Chairs, where you either win or have your memory freed.
<p>
<b>musical_chairs</b> is written using the following structs that cannot be changed:
<p>
<pre>
// player in the game of chairs
struct player {
    char name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
};

// A node in a linked list of chairs
struct chair {
    struct player *sitting;
    struct chair *next;
};
</pre>
<p>
The <b>chair</b> struct is a linked list node.
<p>
The <b>player</b> struct represents a player that can sit on a chair
(represented by the chair's pointer aiming at the player).
<p>
<b>make_music</b> is given a pointer to a <b>chair</b>, which is the
first element in a list of chairs. It is also given an int <b>turns</b>
which represents how many turns of movement there will be before
the music stops.
<p>Like the game of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_chairs">Musical Chairs</a>,
this program will have players move along the linked list, changing
which chair they're sitting in.
<p>In <b>make_music</b>, every player moves <b>turns</b> spaces along
the linked list. Anyone who moves off the end of the linked list, should
then move to the head of the list, so the players will end up rotating
through the list as if it's a loop. This would be similar to if the
<b>next</b> of the last chair was aimed at the first chair.
<p>Once all the players have finished moving, the head of the list of
chairs is removed. This means both that chair and the player sitting in
it are removed from the game. 
<p><b>make_music</b> should then print out the name of the player that
was removed.
<p>Be careful to make sure you free all memory used in this game!
<p>
For example if a list of chairs called <b>thrones</b> looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
throne points at the player named "Spoiler Alert"
throne points at the player named "Eddard Stark"
throne points at the player named "Joffrey Baratheon"
throne points at the player named "Cersei Lannister"
throne points at the player named "Robert Baratheon"
</pre>
<p>
Then the following function is called:
<p>
<pre>
make_music(3, thrones);
</pre>
<p>
The output would be:
<p>
<pre>
Joffrey Baratheon
</pre>
<p>
and the resulting linked list would look like this:
<p>
<pre>
(throne pointed at "Joffrey Baratheon" but was removed)
throne points at the player named "Cersei Lannister"
throne points at the player named "Robert Baratheon"
throne points at the player named "Spoiler Alert"
throne points at the player named "Eddard Stark"
</pre>
<p>
In this list, all the players have moved down 3 chairs and are now sitting in
different chairs. Anyone that moved past the end of the chairs was moved back
to the top of the list of chairs.
<h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>
<p>
<b>struct player</b> and <b>struct chair</b> cannot be edited. They must be
used as they are.
<p>
The <b>be_seated</b> function will help you create chairs. It cannot be edited
and must be used as it is.
<p>
You may not use arrays in this solution. Arrays are not necessary to 
complete this task.
<p>
You must free all memory used in your program. Use 
<code>dcc --leak-check</code> if you need to check for memory leaks. Autotest
will also check your code for leaks
Your submitted file may contain a main function. It will not be tested or marked.
