Write a C program  <code>upside_down.c</code> to read 3 numbers
and indicate whether they are strictly increasing (called "up"), strictly decreasing (called "down"), or neither ("neither").


Reminder: "Strictly Increasing" means that each number is <i>larger</i> than the previous (the sequence "3 4" is strictly increasing, but "3 3" is not).
"Strictly Decreasing" means that each number is <i>less</i> than the previous (the sequence "3 2" is strictly decreasing, but "3 3" is not).
</p>

Your program should behave exactly like this example:


<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o upside_down upside_down.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./upside_down</kbd>
Please enter three numbers: <kbd>5.6 6.5 11.9</kbd>
up
<kbd class="shell">./upside_down</kbd>
Please enter three numbers: <kbd>12.5 5.6 6.5</kbd>
neither
<kbd class="shell">./upside_down</kbd>
Please enter three numbers: <kbd>1.5 1.5 2.5</kbd>
neither
<kbd class="shell">./upside_down</kbd>
Please enter three numbers: <kbd>70.5 42.0 -1.5</kbd>
down
</pre>

You can assume the user supplies 3 doubles.  You do not have to check if the input is valid.
