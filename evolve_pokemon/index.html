{{ copy_a_file(name="evolve_pokemon.c", change_function=['create_pokemon', 'evolve_pokemon', 'print_evolution']) }}

<b>evolve_pokemon</b> is written using the following struct that cannot be changed:
<p>
<pre>
struct pokemon {
    char name[MAX_NAME_SIZE];
    struct pokemon *evolution;
};
</pre>
<p>
<b>create_pokemon</b> should allocate memory for a pokemon struct, set its
name to the input string and return a pointer to it. The evolution pointer
should be set to NULL.
<p>
<b>evolve_pokemon</b> should take two pointers to pokemon. It should set the
second as the evolution of the first. 
<p>
<b>print_evolution</b> should take a pointer to a pokemon. It should print out
the name of the pokemon, then the name of what it evolves to and the name of
what that pokemon evolves to until it reaches a pokemon that doesn't evolve into
anything else. It should print each name on its own line.
<p>
For example if we create two pokemon using the strings "Pikachu" and "Raichu"
<p>
<pre>
struct pokemon *pikachu = create_pokemon("Pikachu");
struct pokemon *raichu = create_pokemon("Raichu");
</pre>
<p>
Then we set pikachu's evolution to be raichu and print the evolution
<p>
<pre>
evolve_pokemon(pikachu, raichu);
print_evolution(pikachu);
</pre>
<p>
The output of this will be:
<p>
<pre>
Pikachu
Raichu
</pre>
<p>
<h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>
<p>
<b>struct pokemon</b> cannot be edited. It must be used as it is.
<p>
<b>create_pokemon</b> should call malloc() to allocate memory.
<p>
<b>evolve_pokemon</b> should not print anything. It should not call printf.
<p>
<b>print_evolution</b> should continue printing names on separate lines until
it reaches a <b>NULL</b> evolution then it will stop.
