<b>struct_create</b> is written using the following struct that cannot be changed:
<p>
<pre>
struct numbers {
    int first;
    int second;
};
</pre>
<p>
<b>struct_create</b> should take two integers as input and return a pointer 
to a struct numbers variable that it has created. Its first input should be 
stored in the first field and its second input should be stored in the second 
field.
<p>
For example if the integers are:
<p>
<pre>
int a = 1;
int b = 2;
</pre>
<p>
and the function is called like this:
<p>
<pre>
struct numbers* n = struct_create(a, b);
</pre>
<b>n</b> will now be pointing at a struct that has n-&gt;first == 1 and n-&gt;second == 2.

<p>
<h4>Assumptions/Restrictions/Clarifications.</h4>
<p>
<b>struct numbers</b> cannot be edited. It must be used as it is.
<p>
<b>struct_create</b> should call malloc() to allocate memory.
<p>
<b>struct_create</b> should not print anything. It should not call printf.
