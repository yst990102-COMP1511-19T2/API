<h1 id="introduction">Castle Defense</h1>
<p>
Attention brave and noble engineers! Castle CSE is under attack by
our Enemies from The Lair. King Marc of House Chee, First of His 
Name, Protector of the Realm, has commissioned you to build His 
defenses and protect His Castle.

<p>
In this assignment, you will be implementing Castle Defense, a program
that simulates an imaginary Realm that is under attack. You will be
creating Lands in the Realm as well as building Towers to defend
a Castle. 

<p>
The Enemies will spawn from their Lair and move towards the Castle
through the Lands.
As the Enemies move, they will be attacked by the towers, which both harms
the Enemies and depletes the towers. If the Enemies reach the Castle, 
they will damage it.

<p>
Your program will be managing Enemy movement as they pass through the
Lands. It will also be managing the use of Towers against the Enemies 
and any damage the Castle receives.

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If this assignment appears daunting, fear not!
The King himself (Marc in lectures) will be demonstrating many of the 
techniques necessary to begin your tasks. His loyal retainers (the
Tutors) will also be teaching some of the techniques in detail in Labs.
During Week 8, a great deal of the course will be dedicated to helping
you get started with this assignment.

<h2 id="realm">The Realm</h2>
<p>
The realm is a struct that contains all of the objects that will be
used in this assignment. Those are: Lands, The Lair, The Castle, Towers
and Enemies.

Your job is to manage the Realm, and everything it contains.

<img alt="Realm Structure" class="img img-responsive" src="{{activities_url}}/castle_defense/Castle Defense Overall.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
<p>
The Realm struct has pointers to The Lair (where all the Enemies 
live), and The Castle (where King Marc and His loyal subjects live).

Every location in the Realm lies on a linked list that starts at The 
Lair, and goes on to The Castle. Locations can have one of three types:
<ul>
<li><i>Land</i>: A place where Enemies can gather.</li>
<li><i>Tower</i>: A defense, built by you, to attack Enemies</li>
<li>
<i>Castle</i>: The Castle, which is always the last node in the
    linked list. If the Enemies can reach The Castle, they will deal
    damage to it.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Your code should ensure that at the start of the program,
the Lair points to the Castle, and the Castle points to <code class="lang-clike">NULL</code>.
Your code should then ensure that the Lair is always connected (through other locations)
to the Castle; and that the Castle points to <code class="lang-clike">NULL</code>.</p>
<p>
To ensure this is true, you will never be given a test case where you are asked to put a
tower after the Castle.
</p>
<p>
As an additional restriction to make the assignment's rules simpler,
there will never be two locations with the same name.
</p>
<h2 id="enemies">Enemies</h2>
<p>
In these dark times, the realm is under attack. Foul Enemies regularly
appear at their Lair and make their way, one location at a time, towards
The Castle.
</p>
<img alt="Enemies" class="img img-responsive" src="{{activities_url}}/castle_defense/Enemies.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
<p>
An Enemy is represented by a struct which records their name, their maximum
health and their current health (as integers). These structs should also be
set up so that the Enemies can be joined together in a linked list.

<p>
Enemies will always be at a location, which is represented by a linked list
of Enemies at every location in The Realm. Linked lists of Enemies are always
listed in alphabetical order.
</p>
<p>
An Enemy dies when it has zero or less health. It then is removed from the
linked list that contained it and its memory is freed.
</p>
<p>
There will never be two enemies in the realm with the same name.
</p>
<h2 id="towers">Towers</h2>
<img alt="Tower and Location detail" class="img img-responsive" src="{{activities_url}}/castle_defense/Tower and Location.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
<p>
As mentioned before, locations in the realm can be Towers. Towers are able to
reduce the HP of any Enemy at their Location. They can only be used a fixed
number of times. When they run out of uses, they convert back into lands.
</p>
<p>Towers have two important properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Power</i>: How much an Enemy's HP is reduced when the Tower attacks. This is a whole number, greater than zero.</li>
<li><i>Uses</i>: A count of how many times a Tower can be used before it 
    reverts to being a land. This is a whole number, greater than zero.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="castle">The Castle</h2>
<p>
At the end of the list is The Castle. Enemies that manage to reach The
Castle will be removed from the game and deal damage to The Castle.
<p>
The Castle starts off with <code class="lang-clike">STARTING_CASTLE_HP</code> health.
If an Enemy damages The Castle, it causes The Castle's health
to decrease by that Enemy's remaining health. 

</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Note: </strong> Nothing special should happen 
 when the castle goes below 0 HP. It can go negative if enough damage is dealt to it.</div>
<h2 id="game">The Game</h2>
<p>
When the game starts, two locations are automatically created - the Lair
and the Castle. You will then be given a list of locations on standard 
input, one per line.
These locations will be strings that do not contain any spaces. 
When the list of locations is complete, an empty line will be input.
</p>
<p>
After this, a prompt will appear. You will type in commands to indicate
changes to the state of the Realm. These commands will all start with a
character as the command, then a space, then possibly some additional
information about the command. There are three special commands, which
are already implemented in the Starter Code provided. They consist of:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="lang-clike">?</code>: Print a list of all possible commands.</li>
<li><code class="lang-clike">q</code>: Quit the program.</li>
<li><code class="lang-clike">/</code>: Do nothing, this line is treated as a comment.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="implementation">Your Task: Implementation</h1>
<p>
Your task for this assignment is to write the functions that will manage
the state of the Realm. All of these functions are contained inside the file
<code class="lang-clike">realm.c</code>. 

<h2 id="starter-code">Starter Code</h2>
<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<a href="{{activities_url}}castle_defense/castle_defense.zip">
<strong>Download the starter code (castle_defense.zip) here</strong>
</a>
or copy it to your CSE account using the following command:
<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">1511 setup-castle-defense</kbd>
</pre>
</div>
<br/>
<p>
The starter code consists of the following files:
<p>
<a href="{{activities_url}}castle_defense/main.c"><code class="lang-clike">main.c</code></a> contains the main function for the assignment.
It will scan the program's input, then call the functions you will write.
<strong>You must not change this file.</strong>
<p>
<a href="{{activities_url}}castle_defense/realm.h"><code class="lang-clike">realm.h</code></a> contains the definitions of all the functions
you will be writing. It also contains useful constants and type definitions.
<strong>You must not change this file.</strong>
<p>
<a href="{{activities_url}}castle_defense/realm.c"><code class="lang-clike">realm.c</code></a> contains empty functions which you will need to implement.
It already contains some functions. It is <i>strongly recommended</i> that you use these.
<strong>This file is where you will write your own code.</strong>
<!-- TODO: example test_realm.c -->
<p>
<a href="{{activities_url}}castle_defense/test_realm.c"><code class="lang-clike">test_realm.c</code></a> contains an empty main function which you can use to test
your own code. You should not do any scanning in this file. 
<strong>This file is where you will write your own test cases.</strong>
<p>
<h2 id="allowed-c-features">Allowed C Features</h2>
<p>
In this assignment, there are two restrictions on C Features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  You must follow the rules explained in
  <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/19T2/resources/style_guide.html">the Style Guide</a>.
</li>
<li>
  You may not use the function <code class="lang-clike">fnmatch</code>, or import <code class="lang-clike">fnmatch.h</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is recommended to only use features that have been taught in COMP1511.
Course work in Week 8 will have a particular focus on assistance for this assignment and
you will not need any of the subject material from Weeks 9 or 10.

<p>
If you choose to disregard this advice, you <b>must</b> still follow the Style Guide. You also may
be unable to get help from course staff if you use features not taught in COMP1511.
</p>
<h2 id="input">Input Commands</h2>
<p>
Input to your program will be via standard input (similar to typing into a
terminal). You <strong>do not</strong> need to read this input yourself.

<p>
Your code should not print or scan from the terminal (standard input or output). 
Do not use or add any <code class="lang-clike">printf </code>or <code class="lang-clike">scanf </code>in <code class="lang-clike">realm.c</code>.
All printing and scanning has already been implemented for you in the starter code.
</p>
<p>
You can assume that input will be handled for you, and that you will never be given
an invalid argument to one of your functions (except as described below).

<p>
Details of how this input will relate to the functions you call are given below:

<h1 id="stage_one">Stage One</h1>
<p>
Stage one involves adding new locations to the realm, as well as being able to
print out the game state.

<h2 id="add_location">Adding to the Realm</h2>
<p>
In <code class="lang-clike">realm.c</code> you have been given two function stubs (a stub is an unimplemented function):
<pre>
<code class="lang-clike">
static Location new_location(char *name) {
    return NULL;
}

void add_location(Realm realm, char *name) {

}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
These two functions should be implemented as described below. 
</p>
<p>
<code class="lang-clike">new_location</code> should use malloc to allocate memory for a new
Location node. It should then set up it's name
(and any other fields you decide you need throughout the assignment). 
<ul>
<li>
Note that the word "static" on this function will make it accessible within this
file, but not elsewhere. We often use static on helper functions that are
not part of the header file and aren't used by any other parts of the program.
Static will not significantly change how you will use this function. 
</li>
<li>
The <code class="lang-clike">new_realm</code> function (already implemented in the starter code)
uses the <code class="lang-clike">new_location</code> function. The <code class="lang-clike">new_realm</code> 
function does not need changing, but you may want to add code to it at a later
stage.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<code class="lang-clike">add_location</code> will be given a Realm and a Location name.
It will then insert a new location node directly
before the <code class="lang-clike">Castle</code> in the linked list of locations.
</p>
<p>
These functions will never receive invalid inputs. 

<img alt="Add Location" class="img img-responsive" src="{{activities_url}}/castle_defense/Insertion.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
<h2 id="print_realm">Printing Out the Realm</h2>
<p>
In <code class="lang-clike">realm.c</code> you have been given the function stub:</p>
<pre>
void print_realm(Realm realm) {

}
</pre>

as well as four fully implemented functions:

<pre>
<code class="lang-clike">
void print_tower(char *name, int power, int uses, Effect effect);
void print_land(char *name);
void print_castle(char *name, int defense);
void print_enemy(char *name, int cur_hp, int max_hp);
</code>
</pre>
<code class="lang-clike">print_realm</code> will be given a realm, and will print out information
about that realm.
You should use the functions given in the starter code to print it out,
instead of calling printf yourself.
<p>
Specifically, <code class="lang-clike">print_realm</code> will list locations in order from The 
Lair to The Castle. If there are any enemies at a location, it will list them in
order before listing the next location.

<p>
One thing to note is that you may be able to start without implementing some of this function.
For instance, if you have not yet implemented enemy health, just print out 0's.
For the castle, you can print out <code class="lang-clike">STARTING_CASTLE_HP</code>
rather than keeping track of the castle's current HP yourself.
</p>

{{ autotest_stage("01") }}

<h1 id="stage_two">Stage Two</h1>
<p>
Stage Two has two new commands. They involve adding defensive Towers to the 
Realm and simulating Enemy movement.
</p>
<h2 id="new_tower">New Towers</h2>

When running the program, you can use the following command to add a new tower:

<pre>
t prev_name name power uses
// for instance
t Lair NewTower 2 2
</pre>
<p>
Which means "Create a new tower, directly after the Location <code class="lang-clike">prev_name </code>,
called <code class="lang-clike">name</code>, that causes <code class="lang-clike">power</code> damage to 
each enemy at it, and that can be used <code class="lang-clike">uses</code> times".
</p>

You have been given the function stub, which will be called by <code class="lang-clike">main.c</code>:
<pre>
<code class="lang-clike">
int new_tower(Realm realm, char *prev_name, char *name, int power, int uses){

}
</code>
</pre>

Your job is to implement this function, such that the code does the following:

<p>
Given a realm, the name of a Location in the realm, and some stats about a
new tower, you should:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Find the Location called prev_name. If one does not exist, return <code class="lang-clike">ERROR_NO_LOCATION</code>
</li>
<li> 
    Ensure that the stats you have been given for power and uses are not below 1.
    If they are, return <code class="lang-clike">ERROR_INVALID_STAT</code>.
  </li>
<li>
   Place a new tower, with the given stats, directly after the location which you found above.
   This tower is inserted into the linked list, which adds an element and does not replace the
   Location prev_name.
  </li>
<li>
   Return <code class="lang-clike">SUCCESS</code> to indicate success.
  </li>
</ul>
<img alt="Adding a Tower" class="img img-responsive" src="{{activities_url}}/castle_defense/New Tower.png" style="max-width: 100%"/>
<h2 id="add_enemies">Add Enemies</h2>

When running the program, you can use the following command to add a new enemy:

<pre>
e location_name name HP
# for instance
e Lair EnemyName 4
</pre>
<p>
Which means "Create a new enemy, at the location <code class="lang-clike">location_name</code>,
called <code class="lang-clike">name</code>, that with maximum HP <code class="lang-clike">hp</code>.
</p>
<p>
You have been given the function stub, which will be called by <code class="lang-clike">main.c
</code> when the above comand has been given:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="lang-clike">
int new_enemy(Realm realm, char *location_name, char *name, int hp) {

}
</code>
</pre>

Your job is to implement this function, such that the code does the following:

<p>
Given a realm, the name of a Location in the realm, and some stats about a
new enemy, you should:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Find the Location called <code class="lang-clike">location_name</code>.
    If one does not exist, return <code class="lang-clike">ERROR_NO_LOCATION</code>
</li>
<li> 
    Ensure that the stats you have been given for HP are not below 1.
    If they are, return <code class="lang-clike">ERROR_INVALID_STAT</code>.
  </li>
<li>
   Place a new enemy, with the given stats, directly after the last enemy at the location you found above.
  </li>
<li>
   Return <code class="lang-clike">SUCCESS</code> to indicate success.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
You are guaranteed that you will only receive enemies in sorted order, and will never 
recieve the same enemy name twice. You do not need to check this. This means that for any list of enemies,
<code class="lang-clike">strcmp(enemy-&gt;name, enemy-&gt;next-&gt;name)</code> will be <i>strictly less than zero</i>.
This guarantee will only be relevant for Stage 4.
</p>
<h2 id="advance_enemies">Advancing Enemies</h2>

When running the program, you can use the following command to move all enemies along.

<pre>n</pre>
<p>
This is called a "tick" in game design (as in, the "tick" of a clock). You have also been given the following function stub:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="lang-clike">
int advance_enemies(Realm realm) {

}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
<code class="lang-clike">advance_enemies</code> will go through the realm, moving each enemy from
their current Location to the next Location in the linked list.
Should any enemies go beyond the castle, they should be removed from the 
realm, and destroyed. You should return the number of enemies removed this way at the end of the function.
The Lair should be empty of enemies after this, all of them having moved to the
next Location in the list.

{{ autotest_stage("02") }}
<h1 id="stage_three">Stage Three</h1>
<p>
Stage Three involves dealing damage, and destroying the realm.
</p>
<h2 id="apply_damage">Damage</h2>
<p>
When running the program, you can use the following command to deal damage to 
Enemies and The Castle. It will also use up "uses" from any Towers that deal
damage to enemies.
</p>
<p>You can deal damage using the following command:</p>
<pre>d</pre>
<p>This will call the following function stub:</p>
<pre>
<code class="lang-clike">
int apply_damage(Realm realm) {

}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Go through each Location in the realm, and do the following if the Location is a Tower:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Go through each Enemy at that Tower, and reduce it's HP by 
  the Tower's power. If an enemy's HP is below zero, remove
  it from the list of Enemies at that location
<li> Reduce that Tower's number of uses left by 1, if it did damage to an enemy.
<li> If that Tower now has no uses remaining, convert it into a Land.
  It should no longer have any effect on passing enemies.
</li></li></li></ul>
</p>
<p><code class="lang-clike">apply_damage</code> should also cause the Castle's defense to decrease, 
by the sum of the HP of each enemy. For instance, if the castle had an enemy with 3 HP, and one with 5 HP,
the Castle's defense would decrease by 8.</p>
<p><code class="lang-clike">apply_damage</code> returns the number of enemies damaged this way.</p>
<h3>Before Applying Damage</h3>

<h2 id="destroy">Freeing Memory and Destroying the Realm</h2>

When you quit the program (using the special command <code class="lang-clike">q</code>), the following stub function
will be called to free your list.

<pre>
<code class="lang-clike">
void destroy_realm(Realm realm);

</pre>
<p>calling this function should free:</p>
<ul>
<li> Each Enemy</li>
<li> Each Location</li>
<li> The Realm struct</li>
<li> Any other memory you have allocated using malloc</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="stage_four">Stage Four</h1>

Stage Four involves applying buffs ("changes in stats") to different parts of the realm.
It also uses the concept of a "search", which is described below:

<h2 id="searching">Searching</h2>
<p>
Stage Four and Five rely on the concept of a search, described by a 
<code class="lang-clike">search_term</code>. The simplest case is just a word, which should try
find an exact match. For instance, searching for "hi" in the array
<code class="lang-clike">{"hiya", "JBhi-fi", "JBHi-Fi", "hi", "HI", "phi"}</code> would only find <code class="lang-clike">"hi"</code>.
</p>
<p>
There are two special characters we can use in a search, however: '?' and '*'.
</p>
<p></p>
 '?' means "any ONE character". For instance, the search "?a" in the array
 {"ha", "haha", "Ha", "sa"} would find {"ha", "Ha", "sa"}. A search for "a?a?" in array
 {"ahah", "ajaP", "aba", "aaPP"} would find {"ahah", "ajaP"}. We may give you more than one
 '?' in a search term.  In simple terms: it's a "blank" character that could match any
 other single character.</p>
<p>
 '*' means "zero or more characters". For instance, the search "h*a"
 in the array {"ha", "haaaaa", "hA3!a"} would find every element.
 You may assume that you will never get more than one '*' in any search term.
</p>
<p>One special case of the "*" is that if it is the first character, it matches anything
that has the specified suffix. For instance, "*abc" matches any string that ends "abc".
Similarly, "abc*" matches any string that starts "abc".</p>
<p>
For the avoidance of doubt: We may give you a string that contains any number of "?"s, and 
at most one "*". For instance, we might give "?abc*z?" (which, for instance, would match "mabcdeuabcza").

<h2 id="buffs">Buffs</h2>
<p>You may use the following command to apply a buff. It is explained below</p>
<pre>
b search_term buff_type buff_amount
</pre>
<p>Using this command will call the following function stub:</p>
<pre>
<code class="lang-clike">
int apply_buff(Realm realm, char *search_term, Buff buff, int amount) {

}
</code>
</pre>
<p>This means to apply the buff described by <code class="lang-clike">buff_type</code> to 
everything matching <code class="lang-clike">search_term</code></p>
<p>There are three seperate Buffs, each of which behaves differently.</p>

          This amount can be negative. If a negative amount would cause an

          the apply_damage function).
        </p>
<p>
          An Enemy can have more current HP than its maximum HP. This buff

<h1 id="stage_five">Stage Five</h1>
<h2 id="Effects">Effects</h2>
<p>You may use the following command to change a tower's effect. It is explained below.</p>
<pre>
f search_term effect_type 
</pre>
<p>Using this command will call the following function stub:</p>
<pre>
<code class="lang-clike">
int apply_effect(Realm realm, char *search_term, Effect effect) {

}
</code>
</pre>
<p>This means to apply the effect described by <code class="lang-clike">effect_type</code> to 
every tower matching <code class="lang-clike">search_term</code></p>
<p>
This function should return the number of towers that match the <code class="lang-clike">search_term</code>
</p>
<p>There are two effects you can apply, as well as the <code class="lang-clike">EFFECT_NONE</code> which removes any special effect from a tower.</p>
<p>All towers start with <code class="lang-clike">EFFECT_NONE</code> when they are created. 
Enemies move from that Tower to the next as normal.</p>
<p>
When a tower's effect becomes something other than <code class="lang-clike">EFFECT_NONE</code>, 
enemies move from that Tower in a different way.  The specifics depend on which effect
is applied to a tower, and is described below
</p>
<p>Note that these Effects only change the way Enemies move. A Tower that has 
an effect will still deal damage and lose uses when applying damage, 
regardless of any effect they have. A Tower that is reduced to 0 uses and 
reverts to a Land will lose any Effects it has.

         to the next Location, and that enemy has HP less than or equal to the current tower's power,
         it stays at the current Tower. Enemies at other locations (which don't have effects)
         move normally.
        </p>

          Enemies at every Location must be sorted alphabetically. You should

          to the next Location, it instead moves backwards to the nearest Tower
          before the current one. (the 
          enemy may skip over multiple lands to reach that Tower). If there 
          are no Towers between the current one and the Lair, the Enemies move 
          back to the Lair.

<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>
It is important to test your program thoroughly to make sure it can manage 
different situations. We have written a full guide to
<a href="{{ url_root + 'resources/testing_adts.html'}}">Testing ADTs!</a>
<h2 id="test_realm">Writing your own Automated Tests</h2>
<p>
As you implement functions in <b>realm.c</b>, you should add tests to
<a href="{{activity_url}}test_realm.c">test_realm.c</a>.

<p>
<code class="lang-clike">test_realm.c</code> is a file that contains a main 
function that is not the same as the interactive program in <code class="lang-clike">main.c</code>. Instead, it runs a series of automatic tests on 
the functionality provided by <code class="lang-clike">realm.h</code> and <code class="lang-clike">realm.c</code>.
<p>
You should add code to this file that tests each function separately. This 
will allow you to run automated tests to find out exactly which parts of your 
program are functioning correctly and which aren't.

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">dcc -o test_castle test_realm.c realm.c</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">./test_castle</kbd>
================== Castle Defense Tests ==================
&gt;&gt; Testing new_realm
... Creating new realm.
... Checking it is not null.
... Destroying realm.
&gt;&gt; Testing print_realm
... This should show an empty realm - it should not crash.
... Destroying realm.
&gt;&gt; Testing add_location.
... Adding locations.
... This should show an realm with three extra locations.
... Destroying realm.
</pre>
<h2 id="autotests">Autotests</h2>
<p>
As usual autotest is available with some simple tests - but your own tests
in <b>test_realm</b> will be more useful at pinpointing exactly which 
functions are and aren't working.

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">1511 autotest castle_defense</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
If you wish to use autotest to view only a specific stage of the assignment, 
you can use autotest-stage. The following example shows how to autotest stage
1 but you can replace the stage number with any stage you would like to test.

<pre class="command_line">

If you have questions about what behaviour your program should exhibit,
we have provided a sample solution for you to use.
